    "**✅ Why This Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "Python reads it like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0 <= age and age <= 12\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means:\n",

    "1. Is age greater than or equal to 0?\n",
    "2. AND is age less than or equal to 12?\n",

    "\n",
    "This is **not** the same! It means:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0 >= age and age <= 12\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would only be true if age is less than or equal to 0 — not what you want when checking for children.\n",
