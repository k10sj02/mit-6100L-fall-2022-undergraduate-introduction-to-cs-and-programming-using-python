    "`None` can feel mysterious when you’re first learning Python. Let’s break it down clearly and with examples. Once you get it, you’ll see it everywhere.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🧠 What is `None`?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, `None` is a **special value** that means *“nothing”*, *“no value here”*, or *“undefined result”*.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like an empty box — it exists, but it doesn't have anything inside.\n",

    "## 🧪 When Do Functions Return `None`?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 1. **When a function doesn’t have a `return` statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "If there’s no `return`, Python automatically returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def say_hello():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "result = say_hello()  # prints: Hello!\n",
    "print(result)         # prints: None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why? Because `say_hello()` doesn't say what to return. Python's default is: “Okay, here’s `None`.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 2. **When a `return` exists but doesn’t return anything**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def do_nothing():\n",
    "    return\n",
    "\n",
    "value = do_nothing()\n",
    "print(value)  # prints: None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Even though there’s a `return`, there’s no value with it — so Python returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 3. **When your function does something (like `print`) but doesn’t return a value**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def double_and_show(x):\n",
    "    print(x * 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "result = double_and_show(5)  # prints: 10\n",
    "print(result)                # prints: None\n",

    "## 🔍 Real-World Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "- `return` is like a vending machine giving you a snack.\n",
    "- `print` is like the machine showing a message: \"Here’s your snack!\"  \n",

    "## ✅ How Can You Check if a Function Returns `None`?\n",
    "\n",

    "## 💡 Why Does This Matter?\n",

    "If you try to use the result of a function that returns `None`, it can break your code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    print(x + y)\n",
    "\n",

    "print(total + 1)  # TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'\n",

    "\n",
    "> `total` is `None`, and you can’t add `None + 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Fix: Use `return` instead of `print` inside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",
    "    return x + y\n",
    "\n",
    "total = add(2, 3)\n",
