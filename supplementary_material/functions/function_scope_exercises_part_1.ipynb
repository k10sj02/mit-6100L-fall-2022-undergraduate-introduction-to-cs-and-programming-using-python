    "You did a strong job describing function scope‚Äîclear and mostly accurate! But yes, here are a few **key concepts** that would deepen your understanding and make your explanation more complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Concepts You Could Add to Strengthen Your Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Immutable vs Mutable Behavior**\n",
    "\n",
    "* In your example, `x` is an `int`, which is **immutable**. That‚Äôs why modifying `x` inside the function doesn‚Äôt change the global `x`.\n",
    "* If you passed a **mutable object** (like a list or dict), the function **could** change it without returning anything‚Äîunless you make a copy inside the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Return Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "* It‚Äôs worth emphasizing that a function doesn‚Äôt change the global variable unless:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * It **returns a value** and you **assign** that value to something (like `z = f(x)`),\n",
    "  * Or it modifies a **mutable** object in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Shadowing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The local variable `x` inside `f(x)` **shadows** the global `x`. Same name, but different scope. This is an example of **name shadowing**‚Äîimportant for debugging and readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Function Call Creates a New Frame**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each function call creates a **new frame** in memory, with its own local variables. This is why variables inside functions don‚Äôt interfere with the rest of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Side Effects (or Lack Thereof)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your function has a small **side effect** (a print statement), but it doesn't mutate anything. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs considered a **pure function** in functional programming, aside from the print.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like a challenge where function scope behaves differently‚Äîmaybe using a list or nested functions to show enclosing scope (`E` in LEGB)?\n"
