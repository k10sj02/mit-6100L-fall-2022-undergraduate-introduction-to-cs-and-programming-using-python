## üß† My Learning Approaches (So Far)

### 1. **Project-Based Learning**
- Built mini projects like Python visual exercises (e.g., Turtle, matplotlib).
- Used real-world datasets to stay motivated and apply relevant concepts meaningfully.

### 2. **Scaffolded Problem Solving with ChatGPT**
- Tried coding problems independently first, then used ChatGPT to debug or provide subtle hints.
- Treated ChatGPT as a pair programmer to help reason through problems iteratively.

### 3. **Reverse Engineering / Walkthroughs**
- Practiced Python by dissecting advanced code examples, mimicking logic, and breaking down how and why specific structures (e.g., loops, conditionals, functions) were used.
- Focused on understanding both the technical and visual design decisions.

### 4. **Incremental Mastery**
- Used a structured, layered approach: e.g., focusing first on conditionals, then loops, and now progressing to functions.
- Revisited older topics briefly before building onto them with more advanced logic.

### 5. **Mental ‚ÄúSprints‚Äù and Cool-Downs**
- Recognized when mental fatigue hit and took intentional breaks or rotated topics to reset.
- Used short-term learning sprints (~1 week) followed by rest or change in activity to retain motivation.

### 6. **Active Watching of Lectures**
- Treated MIT lectures not as passive content but as core curriculum to align coding exercises with theoretical insights.

### 7. **Blending Tools**
- Managed parallel skill growth in SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python‚Äîwhile keeping Python as the current growth priority.
- Aimed to tie all skills together toward a career advancement goal.

### 8. **Problem First, Concept Later**
- Tackled puzzles or challenges without fully mastering theory, then looped back to learn why things worked or failed.
- Built intuition through trial and error.
