    "### 🧠 Takeaway: Tracker vs. Builder Variables in Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing loops, ask yourself:  \n",
    "> **\"Am I counting, collecting, or calculating something over time?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "If yes — you need a **second variable** outside the loop to hold the result.\n",

    "|----------|----------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Counter  | Tracker  | `i`, `num`, `index`  | Moves through a range or list        |\n",
    "| Builder  | Accumulator | `total`, `factorial`, `result` | Stores what you're building up (sum, product, list) |\n",

    "#### 🔁 Visualize it:\n",
    "- One variable **moves** (`num`) – like a runner\n",
    "- One variable **builds** (`factorial`, `total`) – like a construction worker\n",

    "#### ✅ Rule of Thumb:\n",
    "> If you're keeping track of something as the loop runs — **initialize it before the loop.**"
