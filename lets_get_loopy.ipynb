    "# For Loops vs While Loops in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## For Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "A **for loop** is ideal when you know the exact number of iterations in advance or when you're iterating over a sequence of items like a list, range, or string. \n",
    "It is typically used when the number of repetitions is **fixed** or can be determined before the loop starts. \n",
    "The loop runs once for each item in the sequence or range, making it perfect for cases where you want to repeat a block of code a specific number of times. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example use case:** If you need to iterate through each element in a list or need to perform a task for a fixed number of iterations, a **for loop** is most appropriate. \n",
    "For example, if you need to calculate earnings over 30 days, you would use a for loop like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for day in range(30):\n",
    "    # Do something for each day\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## While Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a **while loop** is more suitable when you don't know the number of iterations in advance and need the loop to run until a certain condition is met. \n",
    "A while loop continues to execute the code block as long as the condition specified in the loop remains True. \n",
    "This type of loop is ideal when the stopping condition depends on dynamic factors, like user input, calculations, or changing variables, rather than a predetermined range.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example use case:** If you want to keep doubling a salary until it exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., total earnings > 100), a **while loop** would be ideal, as you don't know how many iterations it will take:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "total_salary = 0\n",
    "daily_salary = 0.01\n",
    "while total_salary < 100:\n",
    "    total_salary += daily_salary\n",
    "    daily_salary *= 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary:\n",
    "- Use a **for loop** when you know the number of iterations or when iterating over a sequence or range.\n",
    "- Use a **while loop** when you don't know the number of iterations in advance and the loop depends on a condition being true."

    "## Choosing the Right Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decide if you need to use a **for loop** or a **while loop**:\n",
    "   * In general, use a **while loop** if you are going to loop until a certain condition is reached\n",
    "   * In general, use a **for loop** if you know how many times you need to loop **or** if you are looping over a set of things\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Set up variable values before the loop for the first iteration of the loop\n",
    "* Update/calculate variable values in the loop \n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing Your Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Test, test, test** - start with small number of iterations and print:\n",
    "   * Run the loop for just a few iterations to make sure it starts correctly\n",
    "   * Print out the variables in the loop to see their values for each iteration:\n",
    "      * `print(f'{varName1=} {varName2=}')`\n",
    "      * NOTE: Printing inside a loop that runs many iterations will be slooooow\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example of testing a for loop\n",
    "for i in range(5):  # Start with small number of iterations\n",
    "    result = i * 2\n",
    "    print(f'{i=} {result=}')  # Debug printing\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Example of testing a while loop\n",
    "counter = 0\n",
    "threshold = 10\n",

    "Loops do **not** create a new variable scope like functions do. It runs in the same scope where it’s defined. Since your loop is in the main program body, everything inside it can safely read and modify global variables like day, daily_rate, and total. So unless a variable is declared inside a function or block (like inside `if`, `def`, or `class`), it's treated as global if defined in the main script."
