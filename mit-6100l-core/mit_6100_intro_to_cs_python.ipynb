It also aims to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably confident in their ability to write simple programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals.

    "1. Divide the number by 2\n",
    "2. Record the remainder (`0` or `1`)\n",
    "3. Update the number to the quotient\n",
    "4. Repeat until the quotient is 0\n",

A programmer writes functions with 0 or more inputs and something to return. A function only runs when it is called and the entire function call is replaced with the return value."

    "## 🧠 What is Abstraction in Programming (Python)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** means focusing on **what something does**, rather than **how it does it**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, abstraction lets you **use complex code through simple interfaces**, without needing to understand the inner workings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Everyday Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a **TV remote**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You press \"Power\" → TV turns on.\n",
    "- You don’t need to know how the signal is sent or how the circuits work.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's **abstraction** — you interact with a **simple control**, not the messy insides.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🐍 Python Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Functions**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def greet(name):\n",
    "    print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "You don’t need to know how `print()` works internally. You just use it.  \n",
    "Same with `greet()` — you abstract the idea of “saying hi.”\n",

    "### 2. **Built-in Methods**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "my_list.sort()\n",
    "```\n",
    "You don’t need to implement the sorting algorithm — you call `.sort()` and it just works.\n",

    "        print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "buddy = Dog()\n",

    "\n",
    "> _“Will it always be a list? Should I check for empty lists?”_\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **3. What should it return (if anything)?**\n",
    "- Does it **return a value** or just perform an action?\n",
    "- What **type** will it return?\n",
    "\n",
    "> _“Should it return a number, or print it directly?”_\n",
    "\n",

    "> Good: `calculate_average()`  \n",
    "> Bad: `func1()`  \n",

    "- Should it throw an error, return a default, or handle it silently?\n",
    "\n",
    "> _“What if someone passes in a string instead of a list?”_\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "- Should it?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
