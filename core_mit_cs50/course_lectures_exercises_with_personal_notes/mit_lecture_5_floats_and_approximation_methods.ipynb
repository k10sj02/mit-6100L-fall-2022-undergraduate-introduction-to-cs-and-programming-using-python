    "# 🧮 Converting Base 10 to Binary (Detailed Lesson)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📘 What is Binary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary is a **base-2** number system that uses only two digits: `0` and `1`. Computers use binary to store and process all kinds of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔢 Decimal (Base 10) vs Binary (Base 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "In base 10, digits represent powers of 10:\n",
    "- 253 = 2×10² + 5×10¹ + 3×10⁰\n",
    "\n",
    "In binary, digits represent powers of 2:\n",
    "- 1101 = 1×2³ + 1×2² + 0×2¹ + 1×2⁰ = 13\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✴️ Part 1: Converting Integers from Base 10 to Binary\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Method: Repeated Division by 2\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Divide the number by 2\n",
    "2. Record the remainder (`0` or `1`)\n",
    "3. Update the number to the quotient\n",
    "4. Repeat until the quotient is 0\n",
    "5. The binary number is the remainders **read in reverse**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Example: Convert 19 to Binary\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "19 ÷ 2 = 9, remainder 1\n",
    " 9 ÷ 2 = 4, remainder 1\n",
    " 4 ÷ 2 = 2, remainder 0\n",
    " 2 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 0\n",
    " 1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now read the remainders bottom to top: **10011**\n",
    "\n",
    "**✔️ So, 19 (base 10) = 10011 (base 2)**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✴️ Part 2: Converting Decimal Parts from Base 10 to Binary\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Method: Repeated Multiplication by 2\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Multiply the decimal part by 2\n",
    "2. Record the **integer part** (0 or 1)\n",
    "3. Repeat with the new fractional part\n",
    "4. Stop when the fractional part becomes 0 **or** you reach desired precision\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Example: Convert 0.375 to Binary\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0.375 × 2 = 0.75   → integer part: 0\n",
    "0.75 × 2  = 1.5    → integer part: 1\n",
    "0.5 × 2   = 1.0    → integer part: 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now read the integer parts in order: **011**\n",
    "\n",
    "**✔️ So, 0.375 (base 10) = 0.011 (base 2)**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔗 Putting It All Together\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert a number like **13.375**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convert `13` → `1101`\n",
    "- Convert `.375` → `.011`\n",
    "\n",
    "**✔️ Final result: 13.375 (base 10) = 1101.011 (base 2)**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Pro Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- For **integers**, think \"divide by 2, collect remainders.\"\n",
    "- For **decimals**, think \"multiply by 2, collect integer parts.\"\n",
    "- This method works for any decimal number, just be mindful of repeating binary decimals (some fractions like 0.1 can't be perfectly represented in binary).\n",
