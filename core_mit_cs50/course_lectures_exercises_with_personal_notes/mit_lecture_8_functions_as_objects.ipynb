    "## 🧠 What is `None`?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, `None` is a **special value** that means *“nothing”*, *“no value here”*, or *“undefined result”*.\n",

    "## 🧪 When Do Functions Return `None`?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 1. **When a function doesn’t have a `return` statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "If there’s no `return`, Python automatically returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def say_hello():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "result = say_hello()  # prints: Hello!\n",
    "print(result)         # prints: None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why? Because `say_hello()` doesn't say what to return. Python's default is: “Okay, here’s `None`.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 2. **When a `return` exists but doesn’t return anything**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def do_nothing():\n",
    "    return\n",
    "\n",
    "value = do_nothing()\n",
    "print(value)  # prints: None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> Even though there’s a `return`, there’s no value with it — so Python returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 3. **When your function does something (like `print`) but doesn’t return a value**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def double_and_show(x):\n",
    "    print(x * 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "result = double_and_show(5)  # prints: 10\n",
    "print(result)                # prints: None\n",

    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Real-World Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "- `return` is like a vending machine giving you a snack.\n",
    "- `print` is like the machine showing a message: \"Here’s your snack!\"  \n",

    "> `total` is `None`, and you can’t add `None + 1`.\n",
    "\n",

    "    return x + y\n",

    "#    * `calc` (which takes another function as an argument)\n",
    "#    * `add`, `sub`, `mult`, and `div` (which perform basic operations)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Then the `print(calc(add, 2, 3))` call happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "#    * The function `add` is passed as the first argument to `calc`, so `op = add`.\n",
    "#    * Inside `calc`, it runs `op(x, y)`, which becomes `add(2, 3)`, returning `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Next, the `print(calc(div, 2, 0))` call:\n",
    "\n",
    "#    * Here, `div` is passed in as the operation.\n",
    "#    * Inside `div(2, 0)`, the condition `if b != 0:` fails, so the function prints `\"Denominator was 0.\"` and returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. As a result:\n",
    "\n",
    "#    * The first `print` outputs `5`\n",
    "#    * The second `print` outputs `None` (because `div(2, 0)` doesn’t return a value when division isn’t possible)\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### 🔑 Key Concepts Highlighted:\n",
    "\n",
    "# * Functions in Python are **first-class objects**, meaning you can pass them as arguments.\n",
    "# * `op(x, y)` inside `calc()` calls whatever function was passed in (like `add`, `sub`, etc.)\n",
    "# * If a function doesn't explicitly `return` a value, it returns `None` by default.\n"
