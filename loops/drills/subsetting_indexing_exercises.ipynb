    "# 📘 Lesson: Indexing and Subsetting in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Why It Matters  \n",
    "Indexing and subsetting let you access, extract, and manipulate individual elements or slices (parts) of data stored in sequences like lists, strings, and tuples. These are critical skills for any Python programmer, especially when working with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. ✅ What Is Indexing?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indexing** means accessing a specific item in a sequence (like a list or string) by its position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses **zero-based indexing**, meaning:\n",
    "- The **first item** is at position `0`\n",
    "- The **second item** is at position `1`\n",
    "- And so on...\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Example: Indexing a List\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "animals = [\"dog\", \"cat\", \"bird\", \"lizard\", \"hamster\"]\n",
    "print(animals[0])  # Output: \"dog\" (first item)\n",
    "print(animals[4])  # Output: \"hamster\" (fifth item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Example: Indexing a String\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "word = \"lizard\"\n",
    "print(word[0])  # Output: 'l' (first letter)\n",
    "print(word[3])  # Output: 'a'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. ❗ Negative Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also supports **negative indexing**, where:\n",
    "- `-1` is the **last** item,\n",
    "- `-2` is the **second-last**, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(animals[-1])  # Output: \"hamster\"\n",
    "print(animals[-2])  # Output: \"lizard\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. 🔍 Subsetting with Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slicing** lets you extract a part of a list or string using this format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sequence[start:stop]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `start`: the index where the slice begins (inclusive)\n",
    "- `stop`: the index where the slice ends (exclusive)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Example: Slice a List\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(animals[1:4])  # Output: ['cat', 'bird', 'lizard']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The slice includes items at index 1, 2, and 3. Index 4 is **not** included.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. ✂️ Advanced Slicing: Step Argument\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use a third value in slicing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sequence[start:stop:step]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(animals[::2])  # Output: ['dog', 'bird', 'hamster'] (every second item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This grabs every second element from the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. 🔁 Indexing Inside Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use an index to loop through a list or string manually:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "index = 0\n",
    "while index < len(animals):\n",
    "    print(animals[index])  # Access each element by index\n",
    "    index += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or more commonly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for animal in animals:\n",
    "    print(animal)  # Automatically gets each element\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. 🔗 Nested Indexing (Indexing Inside Indexing)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a list of strings, you can access both the string and characters inside it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(animals[0])      # \"dog\"\n",
    "print(animals[0][1])   # \"o\" (second letter of \"dog\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is **indexing into an item that’s already been indexed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. 🧪 Common Errors to Avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "- `IndexError`: Happens when you try to access an index outside the range of the list/string.\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  print(animals[5])  # Error! Index 5 does not exist (only 0–4)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Off-by-one errors: Remember that slicing is exclusive of the stop index.\n",

    "# TAKEAWAY:\n",

    "# For example, instead of checking if animals[index] == 0 (which checks the value, not the position),\n",

    "### Understanding `not found` and `found == False`\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, `not` is a logical operator that **inverts** the boolean value of a condition or expression. This concept can be a bit tricky at first, but it’s quite useful once you get the hang of it. Let’s break it down step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **The `not` Operator**:\n",
    "- The `not` operator takes a **boolean expression** and **reverses** it.\n",
    "- If the expression evaluates to `True`, `not` makes it `False`.\n",
    "- If the expression evaluates to `False`, `not` makes it `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a quick example:\n",
    "- `not True` → `False`\n",
    "- `not False` → `True`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **The `found == False` Condition**:\n",
    "- This is a **direct comparison** that asks, \"Is `found` equal to `False`?\"\n",
    "- When you write `found == False`, Python checks if the value of `found` is `False`. If it is, the expression evaluates to `True`; otherwise, it evaluates to `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how it works:\n",
    "- If `found = False`, then `found == False` → `True`\n",
    "- If `found = True`, then `found == False` → `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **The Equivalent of `found == False` with `not found`**:\n",
    "- Python gives us a shortcut to write this comparison more concisely: **`not found`**.\n",
    "- **`not found`** is the same as **`found == False`**, but more **Pythonic** and shorter.\n",
    "- Essentially, `not found` checks if `found` is **False** and **inverts** it into a boolean `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break it down with an example:\n",
    "- **`found = False`**:\n",
    "  - `found == False` → `True`\n",
    "  - `not found` → `True`\n",
    "- **`found = True`**:\n",
    "  - `found == False` → `False`\n",
    "  - `not found` → `False`\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, **`not found`** and **`found == False`** give the same result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Which One to Use?**:\n",
    "- **`not found`** is more **concise** and **idiomatic** in Python.\n",
    "  - It’s shorter and easier to read, especially in conditions like `if not found:` or `while not found:`.\n",
    "- **`found == False`** is a **valid comparison**, but it’s a bit more verbose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Checking if an animal ends with the letter ‘r’\n",
    "\n",
    "In your previous example, you used `found` to track whether any animals had 'r' as their last letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if not found:  # This checks if `found` is False\n",
    "    print('No animals have \"r\" as their last letter')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is equivalent to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if found == False:  # This is the same, but less concise\n",
    "    print('No animals have \"r\" as their last letter')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points:\n",
    "- **`not found`** is a **shorter** and **more Pythonic** way to write **`found == False`**.\n",
    "- Both **`if not found:`** and **`if found == False:`** do the same thing: they check if `found` is **False**.\n",
    "- **`not found`** is easier to read and is commonly used in Python for simplicity and clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "When you use `not found`, you're asking **\"Is `found` False?\"** but in a cleaner, more concise way. If you prefer, you can always use **`found == False`**, but it’s generally considered more Pythonic to use **`not found`** in such situations."
