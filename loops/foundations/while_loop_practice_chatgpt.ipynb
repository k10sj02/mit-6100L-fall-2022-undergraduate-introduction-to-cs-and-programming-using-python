    "## 🧠 Takeaway: Understanding `while ... else` in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "One unique feature of Python is that `while` loops can have an `else` clause — and its placement can be visually confusing at first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What It Means\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `else` block **belongs to the `while` loop**, not an `if` statement inside it.\n",
    "- It runs **only if the loop ends normally** — that is, the loop condition becomes false **without hitting a `break`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Why the Indentation Feels Strange\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `else` line is **aligned with the `while`**, not indented under it.\n",
    "- This might make it seem like the `else` is outside the loop, but it's actually part of the `while` structure, much like how `else` pairs with `if`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "num = 2\n",
    "prime = int(input(\"Enter an integer: \"))\n",
    "\n",
    "while num < prime:\n",
    "    if prime % num == 0:\n",

    "else:\n",

    "> \"While checking possible divisors, if none of them divide evenly (i.e., no `break` happens), then conclude it is a prime number.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "Use `while ... else` when:\n",

    "## Integer Division (`//`) in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integer division** (denoted by `//` in Python) divides two numbers and **returns the whole number part of the quotient**, discarding the remainder. Essentially, it gives you the result of the division without any decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`10 // 3`** gives **3**, because 10 divided by 3 equals 3 with a remainder of 1. The decimal part (0.333...) is discarded.\n",
    "- **`15 // 4`** gives **3**, because 15 divided by 4 equals 3 with a remainder of 3.\n",
    "- **`7 // 2`** gives **3**, because 7 divided by 2 equals 3 with a remainder of 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "When you use `//`, Python divides the numbers just like normal division, but then **rounds down** to the nearest whole number, effectively discarding the decimal portion. This is why the result is always an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It’s Useful:\n",
    "- **Removing the decimal**: If you want to know how many times one number can fit into another without caring about the remainder, integer division is perfect.\n",
    "- **Looping through digits**: In your digit-counting problem, we use `//` to remove the last digit from a number by continuously dividing by 10.\n",
