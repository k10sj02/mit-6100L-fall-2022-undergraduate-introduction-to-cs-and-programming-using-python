    "## üß† Takeaway: Understanding `while ... else` in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "One unique feature of Python is that `while` loops can have an `else` clause ‚Äî and its placement can be visually confusing at first.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ What It Means\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `else` block **belongs to the `while` loop**, not an `if` statement inside it.\n",
    "- It runs **only if the loop ends normally** ‚Äî that is, the loop condition becomes false **without hitting a `break`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîç Why the Indentation Feels Strange\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `else` line is **aligned with the `while`**, not indented under it.\n",
    "- This might make it seem like the `else` is outside the loop, but it's actually part of the `while` structure, much like how `else` pairs with `if`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß™ Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "num = 2\n",
    "prime = int(input(\"Enter an integer: \"))\n",
    "\n",
    "while num < prime:\n",
    "    if prime % num == 0:\n",
    "        print(\"Not prime\")\n",
    "        break\n",

    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Prime\")\n",

    "\n",
    "> \"While checking possible divisors, if none of them divide evenly (i.e., no `break` happens), then conclude it is a prime number.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Pro Tip\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `while ... else` when:\n",
