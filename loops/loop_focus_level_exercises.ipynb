    "## 🧠 Takeaway: Always Check the Most Specific Condition First\n",
    "\n",
    "When using `if`/`elif`/`else` with multiple conditions, **order matters**. If you check for a general condition first (like `divisible by 3`), it might run before the more specific one (like `divisible by both 3 and 5`) — and the code will *never reach* that specific branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔁 What to do:\n",
    "- Always start by asking: \"Is there a case that's more specific or rarer than the others?\"\n",
    "- Write that condition first, especially when it **overlaps** with others.\n",
    "- Think of it like a funnel: big, overlapping conditions go later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💥 The Bug:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if num % 3 == 0:         # This runs first and 'catches' numbers divisible by 3\n",
    "  print(\"Fizz\")\n",
    "elif num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:  # This never gets checked\n",
    "  print(\"FizzBuzz\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ The Fix:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:  # Most specific condition first!\n",
    "  print(\"FizzBuzz\")\n",
    "elif num % 3 == 0:\n",

    "### 🧠 What I Learned About while Loops and Variable Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Through experimenting with two versions of a while loop, I learned the importance of initializing variables outside the loop when I want to track or accumulate values over time. In the first version, I printed individual results (num ** num), while in the second, I used a builder variable to accumulate those results. I noticed that placing builder = 0 outside the loop allowed it to retain and update its value across iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧽 Think of it like a whiteboard: if you wipe the board clean every time the loop runs (by reinitializing builder inside the loop), you lose all the past work. But if you write on the board once and keep adding to it each time (by initializing outside), you build something meaningful over time. This helped me better understand the difference between temporary, per-loop variables and persistent, accumulating ones."

    "## ✅ How to Write Good Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Describe the goal**\n",
    "\n",
    "   What is the task in the simplest terms?\n",
    "\n",
    "   \"I want to count how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 4 or 6.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Break it into steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Think in small, logical moves like:\n",
    "   - Start counting from a number\n",
    "   - Loop until a certain number\n",
    "   - Check a condition\n",
    "   - Keep track of a count or result\n",
    "   - Do something at the end\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoid code-y terms**\n",
    "\n",
    "   Use phrases like:\n",
    "   - \"Check if...\" instead of if\n",
    "   - \"Add one to the counter\" instead of total += 1\n",
    "   - \"Move to the next item\" instead of i += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Keep it sequential and clear**\n",
    "   - Use indentation for clarity\n",
    "   - Order your steps the way the program should flow\n",
    "\n",

    "## ✨ In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your pseudocode like you're explaining your plan to a friend who doesn't code, but can think logically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your logic makes sense in plain language, your code becomes 10× easier to write and debug."
