    "## 🧠 Takeaway: Always Check the Most Specific Condition First\n",
    "\n",
    "When using `if`/`elif`/`else` with multiple conditions, **order matters**. If you check for a general condition first (like `divisible by 3`), it might run before the more specific one (like `divisible by both 3 and 5`) — and the code will *never reach* that specific branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔁 What to do:\n",
    "- Always start by asking: \"Is there a case that's more specific or rarer than the others?\"\n",
    "- Write that condition first, especially when it **overlaps** with others.\n",
    "- Think of it like a funnel: big, overlapping conditions go later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💥 The Bug:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if num % 3 == 0:         # This runs first and 'catches' numbers divisible by 3\n",
    "  print(\"Fizz\")\n",
    "elif num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:  # This never gets checked\n",
    "  print(\"FizzBuzz\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ The Fix:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if num % 3 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:  # Most specific condition first!\n",
    "  print(\"FizzBuzz\")\n",
    "elif num % 3 == 0:\n",
    "  print(\"Fizz\")\n",
    "elif num % 5 == 0:\n",
    "  print(\"Buzz\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "### 🧠 What I Learned About while Loops and Variable Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "Through experimenting with two versions of a while loop, I learned the importance of initializing variables outside the loop when I want to track or accumulate values over time. In the first version, I printed individual results (num ** num), while in the second, I used a builder variable to accumulate those results. I noticed that placing builder = 0 outside the loop allowed it to retain and update its value across iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧽 Think of it like a whiteboard: if you wipe the board clean every time the loop runs (by reinitializing builder inside the loop), you lose all the past work. But if you write on the board once and keep adding to it each time (by initializing outside), you build something meaningful over time. This helped me better understand the difference between temporary, per-loop variables and persistent, accumulating ones."
