    "## 🧠 What Is Binary Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search is a fast way to find a value in a **sorted list**. It works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half and checking if the target is in the left or right half.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key idea**: You don’t check every element. You use the fact that the list is sorted to eliminate half the data at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✍️ How It Works (Conceptually)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you have a sorted list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]\n",
    "target = 9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Look at the middle of the list.\n",
    "2. Is it the target? ✅ Done!\n",
    "3. If it’s **too low**, search the right half.\n",
    "4. If it’s **too high**, search the left half.\n",
    "5. Repeat the steps until found, or the range is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 Binary Search with Loops (while)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def binary_search(numbers, target):\n",
    "    low = 0\n",
    "    high = len(numbers) - 1\n",
    "\n",
    "    while low <= high:\n",
    "        mid = (low + high) // 2  # Find the midpoint\n",
    "        guess = numbers[mid]     # Get the value at the midpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "        if guess == target:\n",
    "            return mid           # Found the target at index mid\n",
    "        elif guess < target:\n",
    "            low = mid + 1        # Search the right half\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            high = mid - 1       # Search the left half\n",
    "\n",
    "    return -1  # Target not found\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Let's Break Down the Core Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🪄 Loop Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while low <= high:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* This condition keeps the loop running **as long as there’s a valid search range.**\n",
    "* Once `low > high`, it means we’ve looked everywhere and didn’t find the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Midpoint Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mid = (low + high) // 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* We always check the **middle** of the current range to eliminate half.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ↕️ Range Narrowing\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if guess < target:\n",
    "    low = mid + 1  # Eliminate the lower half\n",
    "elif guess > target:\n",
    "    high = mid - 1  # Eliminate the upper half\n",
    "```\n",

    "Let’s walk through searching for 9:\n",
    "\n",

    "numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]\n",
    "target = 9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `low = 0`, `high = 6`, `mid = 3` → `numbers[3] = 7`\n",

    "2. `low = 4`, `high = 6`, `mid = 5` → `numbers[5] = 11`\n",
    "\n",
    "   * 11 > 9 → target is in the **left half** → `high = 4`\n",
