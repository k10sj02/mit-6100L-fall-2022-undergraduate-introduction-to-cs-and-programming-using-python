    "1. **Even or Odd Checker**  \n",

    "\n",
    "2. **FizzBuzz Lite**  \n",
    "   Loop from 1 to 30:  \n",
    "   - If divisible by 3, print \"Fizz\"  \n",
    "   - If divisible by 5, print \"Buzz\"  \n",
    "   - If divisible by both, print \"FizzBuzz\"\n",

    "3. **Multiples of 7**  \n",
    "   Print all numbers between 50 and 100 that are divisible by 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Divisor Finder**  \n",
    "   Given a number `n`, print all numbers that divide evenly into it (exclude 1 and n).\n",

    "   Start at 1 and keep adding numbers until the total is over 100.  \n",
    "   Print the final number you added and the total.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Find the Largest Number**  \n",
    "    Given a list of numbers (e.g. `[14, 22, 3, 98, 65]`), use a loop to find the largest one (don’t use `max()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Collect Valid Inputs**  \n",
    "    Loop over a list of strings and store only those that are longer than 5 characters into a new list.\n",
