# MIT 6.100L Extended Learning – Introduction to CS and Programming Using Python

This repository began as a collection of code and exercises from [**MIT’s 6.100L (Fall 2022)**](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-100l-introduction-to-cs-and-programming-using-python-fall-2022/) – *Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python*, taught by **Dr. Ana Bell**. The course introduces core programming concepts using Python, with an emphasis on problem-solving through computation. It's designed for learners with little to no prior programming experience.

As part of my own learning journey, I’ve extended this repo beyond the official coursework to include **supplementary exercises, personal walkthroughs, and challenges** that reinforce key ideas and build fluency in Python. This expanded approach supports my goal of strengthening foundational skills in preparation for upcoming projects and learning tracks from:

1. Harvard’s [**CS50**](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science): Introduction to Programming with Python by **David Malan**
2. Seneca College's **Introduction to Python (PRO675)** with **Morteza Kiadi**
