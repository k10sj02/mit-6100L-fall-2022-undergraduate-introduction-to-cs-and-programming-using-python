# MIT 6.100L Extended Learning – Introduction to CS and Programming Using Python

This repository started as a collection of code and exercises from **MIT’s 6.100L (Fall 2022)** – *Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python*, taught by **Dr. Ana Bell**. The course introduces foundational programming concepts using Python, with a focus on problem-solving through computation. It is designed for learners with little to no prior programming experience.

In addition to the official course material, I’ve incorporated **supplementary exercises and challenges** from other sources — including Harvard’s **CS50** by **David Malan** — to reinforce core concepts and deepen my understanding. This extended approach supports my goal of strengthening my Python foundations in preparation for upcoming projects throughout the year.
