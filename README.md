# MIT 6.100L Extended Learning – Introduction to CS and Programming Using Python

This repository began as a collection of code and exercises from MIT’s 6.100L (Fall 2022) – Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python, taught by Dr. Ana Bell. The course introduces core programming concepts using Python and emphasizes computational problem-solving. It is intended for learners with little to no prior experience.

In addition to the official course material, I’m also including supplementary exercises and challenges from other sources to reinforce key concepts and expand my understanding. This extended approach helps me strengthen my Python foundations and build confidence for upcoming projects throughout the year.
